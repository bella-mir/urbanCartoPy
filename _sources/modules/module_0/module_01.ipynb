    "# Project Overview: 15-Minute City\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is built around the **15-minute city** concept. You won’t just learn the basics of using Python for spatial data analysis and visualization, but **create a small analytical project**, step by step, as you progress through the modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll choose a neighborhood of any city and by the end, you’ll be able to answer the question:\n",
    "_To what extent is the population covered by 15-minute accessibility to all daily needs?_\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll present your findings through **interactive maps**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is the 15-Minute City?\n",
    "\n",
    "The _15-minute city_ is an urban planning concept where everything you need for daily life — schools, shops, work, parks, healthcare, leisure — can be reached within **15 minutes by walking or cycling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create self-contained communities and by that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce long commutes and car dependency\n",
    "- Promote walking, cycling, and transit\n",
    "- Strengthen local communities\n",
    "- Make cities healthier and more sustainable\n",
    "\n",
    "The term was popularized in **2016 by Professor Carlos Moreno** in Paris, but the idea is rooted in earlier planning concepts like **Garden Cities** (Ebenezer Howard, 1902) and **Neighborhood Units** (Clarence Perry, 1920s).\n",
    "\n",
    "## How Do We Evaluate It?\n",
    "\n",
    "A key part of turning the 15-minute city from idea into reality is measuring and analyzing accessibility: How close are amenities actually, and who has (or lacks) access?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using open spatial data (e.g., from OpenStreetMap), we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Map where services (schools, hospitals, shops, transport) are located\n",
    "- Calculate walking accessibility form them (buffers and isochrones)\n",
    "- Overlay population data to see who has access — and who doesn’t\n",
    "- Visualize findings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, each assignment is both a **technical exercise** and a **piece of a bigger project**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Readings & Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "While this project focuses mainly on the **technical side** of spatial data analysis, we also encourage you to explore the broader **urban planning** ideas behind the 15-minute city. The readings below will help you dive deeper into the concept, its history, and real-world applications:\n",
