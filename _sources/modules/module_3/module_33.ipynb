    "# Spatial Aggregation\n",
    "\n",
    "One powerful technique in spatial analysis is **spatial aggregation** — summarizing data based on geographic units.  \n",
    "This helps us move from individual features (like points or lines) to broader patterns and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common use case is analyzing the **density of point features** — such as cafés, crime incidents, or public facilities — across a city or region.  \n",
    "To do this, we often create a **regular grid** (also known as a **fishnet**) that covers the area of interest and then count how many points fall within each grid cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "This regular grid allows for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uniform spatial comparison across the entire area\n",
    "- Easy visualization of patterns and clusters\n",
    "- Compatibility with heatmaps or raster-like outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "This method provides a **visual and quantitative understanding** of how features are distributed in space. It helps to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify hotspots or areas with low activity\n",
    "- Compare different parts of the city based on feature concentration\n",
    "- Support decision-making in urban planning, public services, and resource allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to using a uniform grid, you can also aggregate points by **existing administrative boundaries** — such as districts or neighborhoods — using a **spatial join** followed by a `groupby`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial aggregation turns raw geographic data into structured insights that are easier to analyze and communicate.\n"

    "For example, let’s use the boundary of one of the districts in Saint Petersburg and set the grid cell size to 200 meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll write a simple algorithm that takes the **extent (bounding box)** of the selected area and the desired **cell size**, and generates a `GeoDataFrame` containing a polygon-based grid (fishnet) that fully covers the area.\n"

    "\n",

    "- You're preparing values for **choropleth maps** or **statistical summaries** tied to specific areas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Perform a **spatial join** to assign each point to its corresponding polygon or grid cell\n",
    "2. Use **`groupby()`** on the polygon ID and apply aggregation functions (e.g. `.mean()`, `.sum()`, `.max()`)\n",
    "\n",
