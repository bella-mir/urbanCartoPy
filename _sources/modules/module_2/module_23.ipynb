    "Understanding how to measure areas and distances is a key part of working with spatial data ‚Äî and it‚Äôs no coincidence that this section comes right after the blocks on coordinate systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's because accurate calculations of **distance**, **area**, and even **buffer zones** all depend heavily on the coordinate reference system (CRS) you're using.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is in a geographic CRS (like WGS 84), coordinates are expressed in degrees, which are not suitable for direct distance or area calculations.  \n",
    "To get correct results in **meters** or **square meters**, your data needs to be projected into an appropriate **projected CRS**, like UTM.\n",

    "In GeoPandas, every GeoDataFrame has a special attribute called `.geometry`, which stores the geometric shapes of the spatial features ‚Äî for example, points, lines, or polygons.  \n",
    "This attribute gives you direct access to the geometry of each object in your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have access to the geometry, you can perform various spatial operations.  \n",
    "One particularly useful method is `.area`, which calculates the **area** of each polygon feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here‚Äôs an important note: the `.area` method returns correct values **only if** your data is in a **projected CRS** (like UTM), where coordinates are in meters.  \n",
    "If your data is still in degrees (e.g., EPSG:4326), the area values will be meaningless.\n",
