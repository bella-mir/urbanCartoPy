# Spatial Data Analysis and Visualisation in Urban Cartography

<p style="color:#58568E; font-style:italic">This course is currently under development (as of July 2025). Updates will be posted here.</p>

## What You’ll Create & Learn

In this [course](https://bella-mir.github.io/urbanCartoPy/intro.html), you will apply basic programming skills to analyze and visualize the urban environment. Through hands-on tasks, you’ll explore fundamental cartographic concepts and become familiar with libraries for geospatial data analysis and visualization.

Each topic covers a specific concept in GIS and Cartography and is focused on solving a particular task in urban data analysis.

The final project of the course will combine all the skills you have learned throughout the course and apply them to assessing a city's accessibility within the 15-minute city concept, as well as creating interactive maps to visualize your findings.

## For Whom This Course is Intended

- **Urban Planners** looking to enhance their skills in spatial data analysis and cartography.
- **Anyone Curious** about using Python to analyze and visualize urban data.

## Format

The course consists of a set of Jupyter notebooks (combined into a Jupyter Book) for each module, which you can use either separately or all together. Each module includes basic theory and links to additional resources for self-learning, examples and tasks.

The course is accompanied by short videos explaining key concepts.
It is self-paced with approximately 10–12 hours of content.

At the start and at the end of each module, you may be asked to participate in a short survey to help assess your skills and competencies before and after completing the module. Additionally, you may be asked to submit the results of the tasks (optional).

## Quick Facts

- **Format:** Online, hands-on projects
- **Length:** Self-paced with approximately 10-12 hours of content
- **Prerequisites:** This course does not cover Python basics. If you're new to Python, please complete an introductory course before starting this one.

## Other information

This course is part of a master’s thesis by Bella Mironova within the [Erasmus Mundus Master Programme in Cartography](https://cartographymaster.eu/) (2025), under the supervision of Georg Gartner. More information about this master’s thesis research will be available in the coming months.
