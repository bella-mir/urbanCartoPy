# Urban Cartography Training Course

## About

It is a [training course](https://bella-mir.github.io/urbanCartoPy/intro.html) on spatial data analysis and visualization in urban cartography

<p style="color:#58568E; font-style:italic">The work is still in progress as I'm developing it in July-August 2025. But you can follow thw updates here</p>

The aim of the course is to show how basic programming skills can be applied to analysing and visualising the urban environment. We will cover basic cartographic concepts and get familiar with libraries for geospatial data analysis and visualisation.

The course will not be built around theoretical concepts or specific tools, but rather around the tasks they help to solve. We will explore the urban environment by analysing accessibility and understanding the concept of the 15-minute city, and we will visualise the results on interactive maps.

We will not be covering Python basics in this course, but there are many open courses available to help you acquire foundational knowledge of Python.
